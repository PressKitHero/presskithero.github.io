<h1>A 5 Minute Guide For Creating A Professional Press Kit for your Shopify Store </h1>

<p>
  One way to get more customers and growing your online store is getting your business or product featured in a major publication or website. Getting press coverage is not only important to drive traffic to your online store, but also a way to gain trust in your industry. Being mentioned by major blogs or newspapers gives your business social proof, which will lead to more sales and more press coverage.
</p>

<p>
  A professional press kit presents your product and brand, gives access to photos and other marketing material, gives social proof by listing press coverage, and makes it easy for journalist to get information about your store.
</p>

<p>  
  PresskitHero makes it dead simple to create a professional looking press kit. No coding required. No need to hire a designer.
</p>

<p>  
  With the app you can
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Create a list of press coverage you received... giving your store social proof ("as seen on")    
  </li>
  <li>    
    Present your product and brand
  </li>
  <li>    
    Upload images and other marketing material
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  PresskitHero takes all the information you enter, and automatically generates a well designed and responsive (optimized for mobile and tablets) press kit directly on your Shopify store:

</p>

</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/started/text.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">

<p>
  First write an introduction text for your press kit. Explain what your company does, what products you have, your story, how your business came about. Include some company facts, how many customers you have, how long you have been in business, and any other facts you can share with reporters.
</p>

<h2>
  Add contact information for press inquiries
</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/started/contact.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">

<p>
  Add your contact information for reporters to use to contact you for press inquiries.
</p>

<h2>
  Add press coverage your product has received
</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/started/articles.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">

<p>
  Add every published article, blog post or newspaper story about your product or business. This is good for social proof and a way for reporters to see who else has written about you.
</p>

<h3>
  Use the suggested logo to save time
</h3>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/started/logo-suggestion.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
<p>
  When you enter a link to a published article about your product, PresskitHero automatically suggest a logo of the publication. This will save you some time to search the publications logo yourself... but of course you can also upload a logo yourself if you don't like the suggestion.
</p>
<h2>
  Add awards your product has received
</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/started/awards.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">

<p>
  Maybe your product or company has already received some awards. Include them here for more social proof.
</p>

<h2>
  List the people involved in your company
</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/started/people.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">

Introduce yourself, and your team. List everyone who is involved in your company, what is their name, title or a description of their role in the company.

<h2>
  Upload images, documents, logos and other marketing marterial
</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/started/documents.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">

Lastly you can upload images, screenshots of your app, photos of your product or office, your company's logo, and any other marketing marterial.
